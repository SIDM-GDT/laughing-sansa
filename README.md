DM2341 Server Development module

### Running the unit test 
> * Install Python  

>> * Get the latest 2.7.x version  

>> * (You should have already done this, make sure you choose the option of putting python into the path)  

> * Install the requests Python module  

> > * run the command "pip install requests"  

> > * if pip cannot be found, you have to run it from its location C:\python27\Scripts\pip.exe  

> * Get the unit test file, modify the host location

> > * I would suggest to run the test on the localhost first, as the tests will run faster

> * Run the test by running the test script

> * The test will tell you how many tests have failed

> > * . means test passed

> > * F means test failed

> > * E means that there is an error in the test

Good Luck.
